    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red"> you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>You can write a paragraph here</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The circles indicate some latitudinal distortion as the latitude moves further away from the equator. The longitude is not distorted.</h3>
    <a href="./maps/4326.png">
    <img src="./maps/4326.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The projection is globular, and you can tell because the latitudinal and longitudinal lines are curved. The circles become more distorted as you move away from the prime meridian and the equator.</h3>

    <img src=".//maps/54043.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a>

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has equal distortion between the latitude and longitude because the circles grow proportionally as you move away from the equator and prime meridian.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/3857.png">
    <img src=".//maps/3857.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is globular because the lines of longitude curve as you move away from the equator. Overall, the projection has some distortion as you move away from the equator and some slight distortion in the highest longitudes.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/53018.png">
    <img src=".//maps/53018.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection there is significant distortion in the latitudes furthest away from the equator. Land close to the poles looks very wide. </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54034.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54034.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>Compared to the other projections, this one is unique. The view is similar to looking at a globe from the top, as the north pole is in the center of the projection. As you move away from the north pole, there is more distortion. </h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54027.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54027.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the previous projection, this one is centered on the north pole. They differ slighly in the severity of the longitudinal distortion, as this projection is slightly more equal around the globe than the last.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/102016.png">
    <img src=".//maps/102016.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2>World Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection, the farther away from the equator and prime meridian you go the more distorted the projection is.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54043.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54043.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2>Sphere Times Projection</h2>
    <h3>The circles in this projection increase in size proportionally, revealing that the longitude and latitude are distorted similarly as you move further away from the equator and prime meridian.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/53048.png">
    <img src=".//maps/53048.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
